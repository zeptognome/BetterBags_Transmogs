Better Bags is a bag replacement addon for World of Warcraft, inspired by AdiBags. Better Bags sports a fresh clean look, updated to 2023 World of Warcraft art style.

BetterBags_Transmogs is a plugin for Better Bags that adds categories for gear with uncollected transmogs. Items with the same appearance but from alternate sources under different restrictions are ignored as already leaned. This is shown in game as 'You've collected this appearance but not from this different item.
